# HorseNames
This was originally going to be a simple webscraping project that would use pedigree query, a site that catelogues horse pedigrees, 
to collect names that I would then use to train a simple horse name generator program I was working on. It kept expanding, so now it
also know collects generational data that I will theoretically use for future horse relation projects.
