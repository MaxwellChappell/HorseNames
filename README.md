# HorseNames
This was originally going to be a simple webscraping project that would use pedigree query, a site that catelogues horse pedigrees, 
to collect names that I would then use to train a simple horse name generator program I was working on. It kept expanding, so now it
also know collects generational data that I will theoretically use for future horse relation projects.

Test horse: Cosmo, who raced as Grand Fappy, https://www.pedigreequery.com/grand+fappy
Planned Imporvements
* un hardcode the link and name for a horse, probably change to command line arguement with link to first horses page
* customizing generation list to the actual max length and not just a guess
* instead of having multiple functions to save data, maybe combining them into one with different flags
* renaming of variables for my own clarity
